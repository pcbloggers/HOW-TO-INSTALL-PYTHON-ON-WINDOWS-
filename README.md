<p>One of Python's first universal languages is its unusual combination of object-oriented structures and plain syntax. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Python is also an interpreted language, which means that you don't have to learn how to compile your code into the machine language: that is what Python does for you, helping you sometimes quickly and in a way to test your programs when writing the code.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Python First released in 1991 by &nbsp;Guido van Rossum.</strong></li><li><strong>High-Level interpreted and general purpose programming language.</strong></li><li><strong>Simple and easy to learn programming language.</strong></li><li><strong>Normally used in Web Development , Game Development</strong> <strong>, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</strong> <strong>and other purposes</strong>.</li></ul>

<p>Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li><li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li><li>Simple is better than complex.</li><li>Complex is better than complicated.</li><li>Readability counts.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Python is a fun language with modules for practically anything you can think to do with it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see, Python is simple to learn, and if you're careful with yourself, you might find yourself learning and writing Python code with the same fluidity as you do your native language.</p>

<p>Python is an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. It does not, unlike many other languages, use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are permitted but seldom, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a little installing and a little tweaking, you have python3 version installed and you’re ready for whatever Python project you want to tackle.</p>
